  <h1>The Twinning</h1>
  <p><em>"In the beginning there was Time. In the end, there was Space."</em></p>
  <p>Welcome to the Twinning. You have entered a rift in time and space that is not limited to the laws of physics you were
    once used to. Should you choose to continue this journey into the unknown, you will learn the truth about time and space.. However,
    curiosity can be dangerous, should you wish to become a member of the Clarions Accord, continue on. </p>
  <hr>
  <h2>What is the Clarions Accord?</h2>
  <p>The Clarions Accord's focus is to maintan balance across the universe. We are responsible for creating lifeforms,
    destroying galaxies, and creating brand new universes with their own set of rules. We are the beginning, we are the end.</p>
  <h3>Why would I want to join?</h3>
  <p>Why do we live? Why do we eat? Why do laugh? Why do we cry? Such interesting things
    when you take the time to think about such trivial questions. If you would like answers to these questions
    perhaps you're in the right place..</p>
  <h4>Choose your faction</h4>
  <p>There are a define few who keep each part of the universe in check. Without them, everything
    we've come to know would cease to exsist.</p>
  <p>To keep the universe as balanced as possible, the Clarions Accord split off into three distinct, although very
    important classes.</p>

    <li>The Clarions of <a href="Alexander.html">Alexander</a> </li>
    <li>The Clarions of <a href="Omega.html">Omega</a> </li>
